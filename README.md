## Project Overview

**GitGrub** is a course project demonstrating end-to-end software engineering practice: requirements, design, implementation, testing, documentation, and delivery.  
It includes:

- Production code (`Code/`)
- Formal artifacts (SRS, design docs, user stories, test cases in `Documents/`)
- Visual models (UML, ER, sequence, architecture in `Diagrams/`)

**TL;DR**: _GitGrub is a **[TODO: one-liner project description]**._

## Core Features

- **User Management** ‚Äì Customers and canteen staff can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely, with options for password recovery and role-based access control.
- **Menu Management** ‚Äì Canteen owners/managers can add, update, categorize, and remove menu items (breakfast, lunch, snacks, beverages) to keep offerings up to date.
- **Order Processing** ‚Äì Customers can browse menus, place online/offline orders, select dine-in/takeaway options, and track their order status in real time.
- **Cart & History** ‚Äì Users can manage their cart before checkout and view past order history for convenience.
- **Inventory Management** ‚Äì Managers can monitor ingredient stock levels, update inventory, and reduce wastage by ensuring availability of required items.
- **Employee Management** ‚Äì Admins can add and manage staff details, assign roles (chef, waiter, cleaner), schedule shifts, and supervise employee activities.
- **Sales & Analytics** ‚Äì Owners can track sales records, generate reports, and view analytics for insights into business performance.
- **Review & Feedback System** ‚Äì Customers can leave reviews and ratings on food items/orders, while admins can monitor feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Transaction Management** ‚Äì Provides payment options and records salary/financial transactions, ensuring accuracy and transparency.
- **Notifications & Alerts** ‚Äì Real-time updates on order readiness, status changes, or special promotions to keep customers informed.
- **Security & Privacy** ‚Äì Implements authentication, authorization, and encryption to safeguard sensitive user and financial data.
